Snapshoter
==========

The Problem
-----------

Highly JS-intensive websites like those built with
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) tend to be penalized in SEO terms. Search
engines' crawlers are not generally able - or trusting enough - to execute
client-side JS in order to understand what would be the end-result DOM.

As a massive [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) app,
[Virgin America](https://wwww.virginamerica.com/)'s site serves as a good
example. When users visit an URL such as
`https://www.virginamerica.com/book/ow/a1/nyc_sfo` they expect a visual result
similar to this:

![NYC-SFO Calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/master/docs/images/nyc-sfo-calendar.png)

In fact, this rendering is dynamically generated by an AngularJS app. If one
would open the code inspector and search for the keyword 'November', the
following DOM would be visible:

    ...
    <header class="month__header">
        <h1 bo-text="month.monthYear">November 2014</h1>
    </header>
    ...

However a simple HTTP request like the one below, would bring the basic,
JS-unchanged version of the HTML:

    curl https://www.virginamerica.com/book/ow/a1/nyc_sfo

This former method is the most traditional across crawlers and therefore your
AngularJS (or heavy JS) website will not be indexed accordingly.
