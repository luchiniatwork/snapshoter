Snapshoter
==========

The Problem
-----------

Highly JS-intensive websites like those built with
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) tend to be penalized in SEO terms. Search
engines' crawlers are not generally able - or trusting enough - to execute
client-side JS in order to understand what would be the end-result DOM.

As a massive [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) app,
[Virgin America](https://wwww.virginamerica.com/)'s site serves as a good
example. When users visit an URL such as
`https://www.virginamerica.com/book/ow/a1/nyc_sfo` they expect a visual result
similar to this:

![NYC-SFO Calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/master/docs/images/nyc-sfo-calendar.png)

In fact, this rendering is dynamically generated by an AngularJS app. If one
would open the code inspector and search for the keyword 'November', the
following DOM would be visible:

    ...
    <header class="month__header">
        <h1 bo-text="month.monthYear">November 2014</h1>
    </header>
    ...

However a simple HTTP request - like the one below - would yield the basic,
JS-unchanged version of the HTML or no reference to 'November' would be
possible:

    curl https://www.virginamerica.com/book/ow/a1/nyc_sfo

This former method is the most traditional across crawlers and therefore your
AngularJS (or heavy JS) website will not be indexed accordingly.

The Solution
------------

The solution proposed by Google and adopted by most search engines is described
at the [Escaped Fragment Full Specification](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification). A further detailed how-to can be found on [Google's AJAX-Crawling - Getting Starts](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started).

In practice this specification allows developers to let the crawler know that
this site is rendered via JS. The crawler is then able to call a modified URL
that can be trapped by the server in order to provide a static, previosuly
rendered version of the website back to the crawler.

There are two mechanisms that can be used by developers to let the crawler know
that the site needs this treatment: use hasbangs on the URLs or adding a
fragment meta tag.

The first method, hashbangs, means converting URLs like this:

    www.example.com/ajax.html#key=value

into this:

    www.example.com/ajax.html#!key=value

The crawler will automatically understand that this site is specially-rendered
and would convert the request to:

    www.example.com/ajax.html?_escaped_fragment_=key=value

The second method, adding a fragment meta tag, means including a special meta
tag in the head of the HTML of your page. The meta tag takes the following form:

    <meta name="fragment" content="!">

Independently of the chosen method, you need to set up your server to handle
requests for URLs that contain `_escaped_fragment_`.

Suppose you would like to get `www.example.com/index.html#!key=value` indexed.
Your part of the agreement is to provide the crawler with an HTML snapshot of
this URL, so that the crawler sees the content. How will your server know when
return an HTML snapshot instead of a regular page? The answer is the URL that
is requested by the crawler: the crawler will modify each AJAX URLs.

Snapshoter's Architecture
-------------------------

Snapshoter takes the heavylifting off of your HTTP servers. It servers xxx 
needs:

1. Treats all `_escaped_fragment_` calls that your HTTP servers receive
2. Generates static snapshots of the dynamic pages on the fly
3. Caches snapshots for fast responses
4. Updates cached snapshots on a queued manner
5. Offers queue management facilities 

The following diagram represents the architectural components of Snapshoter:

![Architectural Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/master/docs/images/architectural-diagram.png)

The next session describes each architectural component in details.

Components Described
--------------------

**Your own HTTP Server(s)**

These servers must be set up to mod_redirect and context switch when the
`_escaped_fragment_` URL is identified. These requests must be processed by
the Snapshoter's HTTP Entrypoint.

I.e., considering that Virgin America's website is using the fragment meta tag
method, the following URL:

    https://www.virginamerica.com/book/ow/a1/nyc_sfo

will be converted by crawlers to:

    https://www.virginamerica.com/?_escaped_fragment_=book%2Fow%2Fa1%2Fnyc_sfo

Your HTTP must detect this request and encapsulate (not redirect) a request to
your Snapshoter's HTTP Entrypoint installation (i.e. residing at
`snapshoter.example.com`):

    http://snapshoter.example.com/snapshots?fragment=book%2Fow%2Fa1%2Fnyc_sfo

More details about how to set up your domain on the settings section below.


**Snapshoter's HTTP Entrypoint**

Snapshoter's HTTP Entrypoint is the main component of Snapshoter. It servers as
a HTTP faced to the outside world and orchestrates most of the logic for
taking snapshots of dynamic websites.

It takes in URLs such as:

    http://snapshoter.example.com/snapshots?fragment=book%2Fow%2Fa1%2Fnyc_sfo

This entrypoint will check whether there's a cached version of this snapshot,
if not, it will dynamically generate the snapshot and save it for later use.


**Redis**

Snapshoter uses Redis for its cache as well as for controlling the queue of
cache updates.


**Queue Worker**

A queue worker is a process (or server) that will go through queued up cache
update jobs and update them accordingly.


**Queue UI**

In order to manage the queue, an optional queue management UI is offered as part
of Snapshoter's package.


Setting up Redis (snapshot-redis)
---------------------------------

A vanilla Redis server is required by Snapshoter. A sample [redis.conf](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/blob/master/snapshot-redis/redis.conf)
is provided for reference.

All sample Redis files are found on
[snapshot-redis](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-redis).

If you use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a Dockerfile is provided in the
[snapshot-redis](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-redis) folder. The `build_image.sh` script trigers a named image build and
`refresh_container.sh` stops, deletes, recreates and runs a container out of it.

You should also refer to the Dockerfile in terms of dependencies.


Setting up the HTTP Entrypoint (snapshot-app)
---------------------------------------------

Snapshoter's HTTP entrypoint is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) app.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Refer to [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/) for specifc details for your target
environment.

If you use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a Dockerfile is provided in the
[snapshot-app](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-app) folder. The `build_image.sh` script trigers a named image build and
`refresh_container.sh` stops, deletes, recreates and runs a container out of it.

Other dependencies may also apply depending on your setup. Refer to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-app/Dockerfile) for details.

For Debian Jessie, for instance, you may need to run the following:

    $ apt-get -y update && \
        apt-get install -y \
        libfreetype6 \
        libfontconfig \
        nodejs \
        npm \
        git

**IMPORTANT**: some Linux distributions (such as Debian Jessie) have Node.js'
binary as `nodejs`. This is incompatible with Snapshoter. If that's your case,
make sure to symlink it with:

    sudo ln /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

The server runs on port 3000 so make sure to remap your ports when running the
container or the process on the server.

The triggering command is:

    node src/index.js

Before running the server, set up the following environment variables:

    export CACHE_LIFETIME=300000
    export BASE_URL=https://www.virginamerica.com/

`CACHE_LIFETIME` is the maximum allowed age (in miliseconds) of the cached
snapshot (i.e. 300000 equals 5 minutes). `BASE_URL` is the base URL that will
preface all requests to the dynamic portion of the webserver.

If you are using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), this container will need to
be linked to the Redis container under the alias `redis` such as:

    docker run \
      --name snapshot-app \
      --link snapshot-redis:redis \
      -p 3000:3000 \
      -e CACHE_LIFETIME=300000 \
      -e BASE_URL=https://www.virginamerica.com/ \
      -d \
      snapshot-app

Notice the `--link snapshot-redis:redis`. This will link this container with the
redis one.

Also notice the port mapping on 3000. Remember to set this up according to your
environment.

If you are not using Docker, then make sure to specify the following
environment variables:

    export REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT=49161
    export REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR=192.168.59.103

Where `REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR` should point to the IP address of your Redis
instance and `REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT` should point to the IP port of your
Redis instance.

Make sure to have all Node.js dependencies sorted before running the
triggering point process:

    npm install

For further questions, refer to the respective Dockerfile.


Setting up Worker (snapshot-worker)
-----------------------------------

The worker is another instance of the main Snapshoter app but with another
script to be spawned:

    node src/worker.js

In practice, the worker has the same requirements as the HTTP entrypoint in
terms of Linux system and dependencies but can be started with no need for the
environment variables.

If you use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a Dockerfile is provided in the
[snapshot-worker](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-worker) folder. The `build_image.sh` script trigers a named image build and
`refresh_container.sh` stops, deletes, recreates and runs a container out of it.

Other dependencies may also apply depending on your setup. Refer to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-worker/Dockerfile) for details.

For Debian Jessie, for instance, you may need to run the following:

    $ apt-get -y update && \
        apt-get install -y \
        libfreetype6 \
        libfontconfig \
        nodejs \
        npm \
        git

**IMPORTANT**: some Linux distributions (such as Debian Jessie) have Node.js'
binary as `nodejs`. This is incompatible with Snapshoter. If that's your case,
make sure to symlink it with:

Before running the server, set up the following environment variables:

    export CACHE_LIFETIME=300000
    export BASE_URL=https://www.virginamerica.com/

`CACHE_LIFETIME` is the maximum allowed age (in miliseconds) of the cached
snapshot (i.e. 300000 equals 5 minutes). `BASE_URL` is the base URL that will
preface all requests to the dynamic portion of the webserver.

If you are using the provided Dockerfile, you'll be able to start the container
by:

    docker run \
      --name snapshot-worker \
      --link snapshot-redis:redis \
      -d \
      snapshot-app \
      node src/worker.js

Notice the `--link snapshot-redis:redis`. This will link this container with the
redis one.

If you are not using Docker, then make sure to specify the following
environment variables:

    export REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT=49161
    export REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR=192.168.59.103

Where `REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR` should point to the IP address of your Redis
instance and `REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT` should point to the IP port of your
Redis instance.

Make sure to have all Node.js dependencies sorted before running the
triggering point process:

    npm install

For further questions, refer to the respective Dockerfile.


Setting up Queue UI (snapshot-kue-ui)
-------------------------------------

The Queue UI is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) app.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Refer to [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/) for specifc details for your target
environment.

If you use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a Dockerfile is provided in the
[snapshot-kue-ui](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-kue-ui) folder. The `build_image.sh` script trigers a named image build and
`refresh_container.sh` stops, deletes, recreates and runs a container out of it.

Other dependencies may also apply depending on your setup. Refer to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/snapshoter/tree/master/snapshot-kue-ui/Dockerfile) for details.

For Debian Jessie, for instance, you may need to run the following:

    $ apt-get -y update && \
        apt-get install -y \
        nodejs \
        npm \
        git

**IMPORTANT**: some Linux distributions (such as Debian Jessie) have Node.js'
binary as `nodejs`. This is incompatible with Snapshoter. If that's your case,
make sure to symlink it with:

    sudo ln /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

The server runs on port 3000 so make sure to remap your ports when running the
container or the process on the server.

The triggering command is:

    node src/index.js

Before running the server, set up the following environment variables:

    export KUE_USERNAME=admin
    export KUE_PASSWORD=password

`KUE_USERNAME` is the username that will be used by the UI to authenticate
users. `KUE_PASSWORD` is the password that will be used by the UI to
authenticate users.

If you are using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), this container will need to
be linked to the Redis container under the alias `redis` such as:

    docker run \
      --name snapshot-kue-ui \
      --link snapshot-redis:redis \
      -p 3001:3000 \
      -e KUE_USERNAME=admin \
      -e KUE_PASSWORD=password \
      -d \
      snapshot-kue-ui

Notice the `--link snapshot-redis:redis`. This will link this container with the
redis one.

Also notice the port mapping on 3000. Remember to set this up according to your
environment.

If you are not using Docker, then make sure to specify the following
environment variables:

    export REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT=49161
    export REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR=192.168.59.103

Where `REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR` should point to the IP address of your Redis
instance and `REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT` should point to the IP port of your
Redis instance.
